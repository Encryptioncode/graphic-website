- scroll controlled animation and content

## Check out what's done

- Scroll through effects sequence
  - Data security redefined and Encryption code 2.2 float in and fade in
  - 4 lines come in from 2 sides and all new features fades in
  - Black page opens upwards revealing 99% encryption accuracy
  - Encryption accuracy stops moving down and stays with other words
  - 99% moves down to more efficient algorithms
  - Security is built in
  - Security features fade in
  - screen fades from black to white and encryption code beta pro fade from white to black
  - screen fades back to white
  - computer animation
  - enlarging logo

- problems
  - the 99% thing staying in the center while scrolling moves up and down a bit too much
  - it takes some time to load in the begining because it has to load the images
  - the enlarging logo takes too much scrolling time and distance to enlarge

- computer animating
  - has multiple frames from different angles and display them one by one
  - also it takes almost 300 lines of code for the animation and 143 for the image loading

- Enlarging logo
  - logo enlarges as you scroll and then you go through it
  - I made a high res logo for this
  - it works, but then the gif and text after does not show
